# weather-app
Create a mini-app around the weather using data from an API

## What is this ?
It's a mini-project in order to improve with vanilla JS & vanilla CSS

Morever, I want to improve in API's using

To do this, this project is an opportunity to useÂ [OpenWeatherMap's API](https://openweathermap.org/ "Go to the OpenWeather's website")

## Languages and Tools used :
* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* API Rest, JSON
* Webpack & Babel

To use dependencies :

On first : `npm install`

* Compile JS files : `npm run build`
* Run app on local server : `npm run start`

## Why I've chosen this theme ?
Here again, I want to improve my skills on JS

By the way, I wish to work a project around API's consumption
